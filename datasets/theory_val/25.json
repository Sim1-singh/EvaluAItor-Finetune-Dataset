This can include stack allocation for function calls and heap allocation for dynamic memory. The memory is then managed by the program to store and retrieve data throughout its execution. Once the program terminates, memory is deallocated to ensure efficient use of resources."

It helps users access websites and other online services easily by allowing them to type in familiar names rather than complex numerical IP addresses. DNS also plays a crucial role in routing internet traffic and ensuring the reliability and security of online communications."

Horizontal scaling offers better scalability and flexibility, as it can handle increasing loads by adding more servers. However, vertical scaling is usually easier to implement and manage since it involves upgrading existing hardware. Horizontal scaling is more cost-effective in the long run, while vertical scaling may be more suitable for smaller workloads with limited resources."
