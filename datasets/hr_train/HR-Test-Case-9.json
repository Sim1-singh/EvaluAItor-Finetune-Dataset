The front-end was built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface. The back-end, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handled user requests, while MongoDB stored and retrieved data for seamless interactions.\n\nThe website allowed users to browse a diverse menu, select items, and place orders with an intuitive checkout process. Integration with a secure payment gateway ensured smooth transactions. Additionally, user accounts were implemented for personalized experiences, including order history and preferences.\n\nImplementing real-time order tracking and notifications enhanced user engagement. The project aimed at providing a user-friendly and efficient platform for food ordering and delivery. "
