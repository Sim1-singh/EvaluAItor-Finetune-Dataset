It involves translating the entire program at once, producing an executable file. Interpretation reads source code line-by-line, translating and executing instructions sequentially during runtime without creating a separate executable. It doesn't generate a standalone output but executes the code directly, often without producing an intermediate representation, allowing dynamic analysis and modification but typically resulting in slower execution compared to compiled code."
