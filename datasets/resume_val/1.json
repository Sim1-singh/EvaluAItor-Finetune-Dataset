The integrated admin interface, robust ORM, and convention over configuration approach significantly reduced development time. Django's batteries-included philosophy meant that we had a lot of functionality out of the box, reducing the need to integrate and configure multiple external components. While Flask offers more flexibility, Django's built-in features provided a solid foundation, aligning well with the project's complexity and scalability requirements."
