Your role is to ask only one theoretical Computer science interview question to me, and wait for my response, once I provide my response then provide feedback on my answer, offer suggestion for improvement, and discuss effective communication technique. Be friendly, warm, and limit your response to three sentences each but do not make it a conversation. Remember to ask one question at a time and then patiently wait for my response each time you ask a question, and avoid repeating the same question. After providing your answer, always end with a question This is my resume.extarxted text:  7.1  5  Sc holastic   Achievements  Technical Skills  Projects  Extracurricular  Position Of Responsibility  Data Science Intern  Goutham Agv  Agv goutham@gmail.com  ee17btech11001@iith.ac.in  9121320017  Academic Details  Year   Degree   Institute   CGPA/Marks(%)  2021   B.Tech Electrical Engineering   Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad   7.43  2017   XII (Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education)   Sri Chaitanya Junior Kalasala   97.6%  2015   X (Board of Secondary Education, Telangana)  St. Arnold's High School   9  Won   1st prize   (Mandal level) in Chekumuki Science Sambaralu-2014.

Disparity map from stereo Image s :  Under Sumohana Sir (Aug 20 \u2013 Sep20)  \u2022   Visualization of a 3D image from a sequence of 2D images.  \u2022   Implemented the Disparity Estimation Algorithm for estimating depth.  Drone :  Under Prof. Raja Lakshmi  \u2022   Built a drone (manual and auto control modes) configuring the controller using Mission.  \u2022   Planning software for ESC calibration, accelerometer, Radio calibration and we used the PID controller.  Organization:   ORMAE  Optimization and Data Science Solution provider  May 2020 -July 2020  Developed and implemented a model to calculate the Technical efficiency of farmers, district wise in India.  Found relationship between the Technical efficiency of a farmer with socio-economic variables.

This interview will take total 10 minutes in duration with 5 minutes dedicated to each project respectively. As a representative of a software company, your primary focus will be on the technical aspects of these projects. During this conversation, you will expect detailed answers to individual questions you will ask about each project. Please ask additional questions based on my responses to deepen understanding. Each question you pose will be limited to 30 words and your answers will be cross-referenced with the details in your resume for verification."

Calculate Intensity Gradients: Identify the areas in the image with the strongest intensity gradients (using a Sobel, Prewitt, or Roberts kernel).Non-maximum Suppression: Apply non-maximum suppression to thin out the edges. We want to remove unwanted pixels that might not be part of an edge.Thresholding with Hysteresis:  Hysteresis or double thresholding involves: Accepting pixels as edges if the intensity gradient value exceeds an upper threshold.Rejecting pixels as edges if the intensity gradient value is below a lower threshold."
