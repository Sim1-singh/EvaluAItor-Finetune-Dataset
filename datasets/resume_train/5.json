The goal was to provide a solution that could offer accurate and reliable predictions of used car prices.The used car market often lacks transparency and standardized pricing, leading to uncertainties for buyers and sellers alike. Buyers struggle to gauge the fair value of a used car, while sellers might have difficulty setting a competitive yet reasonable price. This gap in information can lead to inefficient transactions and dissatisfaction for both parties.The project aimed to bridge this information gap by leveraging advanced technologies in machine learning, image analysis, and natural language processing. The objective was to create a tool that could analyze various aspects of a used car, including its condition, features, and textual descriptions, to predict its price accurately. Ultimately, the motivation was to empower both buyers and sellers with a reliable, data-driven tool that could enhance transparency and facilitate fair and informed transactions in the used car market."
