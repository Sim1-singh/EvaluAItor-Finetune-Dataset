After edge detection, we utilized the Bag of Visual Words (BoW) model, a technique commonly used in computer vision tasks, to classify these images. The BoW model helped in organizing visual features extracted from the images into a representative visual vocabulary, enabling classification of hand gestures based on learned patterns."
