            "content": "A stateless architecture in web development means servers don't retain client session data between requests. Each request contains all needed info, making servers unaware of past interactions. It scales better, simplifies maintenance, and ensures reliability but requires client-side data management for session persistence."

            "content": "Middleware in web frameworks functions as an intermediary layer between client requests and the main application. It intercepts incoming requests, enabling tasks such as authentication, logging, or data modification before reaching the core application logic. This modular approach allows for reusable and customizable components, streamlining the handling of HTTP requests and augmenting the application's capabilities without directly altering its core functionality."

            "role": "user",
            "content": "Version control tracks changes in files over time, allowing collaboration and management of different versions. 'git rebase' in Git restructures commit history by integrating changes from one branch onto another, creating a linear sequence of commits. Unlike 'git merge,' it avoids unnecessary merge commits, resulting in a cleaner history. However, it modifies the commit history, potentially causing conflicts, and requires caution when used in shared branches to avoid disruption."

            "role": "user",
            "content": "The 'Command' design pattern encapsulates requests as objects, enabling parameterization of actions, queueing of operations, and support for undo/redo functionalities. It decouples sender and receiver, allowing extensible and reusable command objects. "
